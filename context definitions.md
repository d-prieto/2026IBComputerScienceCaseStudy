# Context definitions

## Purpose

This file has 2 intentions

1st is going to allow the students know the dynamic of how to use github and start editing information in markdown in this repository and start their research 

2nd is going to use more broad and basic terms that are used in the case study so they have a broad understanding before jumping in.

  ### Internet of Things 
  Internet of things (IoT) refers to the network of devices with sensors, processing ability, software and the technology that connect and exchange data between devices and    the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. This means everyday tools like toothbrushes, cars or other machines can use sensors to gather data and respond to       users.

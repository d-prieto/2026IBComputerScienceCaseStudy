# Context definitions

## Purpose

This file has 2 intentions

1st is going to allow the students know the dynamic of how to use github and start editing information in markdown in this repository and start their research 

2nd is going to use more broad and basic terms that are used in the case study so they have a broad understanding before jumping in. 

  ## Definitions

  ### Hacker
Hacker is a person with advanced knowledge of computer systems, networks and programming that uses his knowledge to investigate or gain unauthorized access to systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities

  ### Internal communication (in a hospital)
Internal communications in the context of a hospital is a broad term that refers to all the methods to communicate with the employees. In the context of computer science, it refers to digital methods. This communication is used to send information between the hospitalâ€™s system and the employees, between employees and between departments.  

Modern types of communication: 

    Email 

    Intranet systems

Old types of communication: 

    Pager/Beeper

  ### Internet of Things 
  Internet of things (IoT) refers to the network of devices with sensors, processing ability, software and the technology that connect and exchange data between devices and    the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. This means everyday tools like toothbrushes, cars or other machines can use sensors to gather data and respond to       users.

  ### Intelligence (in context of cybersecurity)
  
  The term intelligence stands for knowledge in the context of cybersecurity this knowledge concerns cybersecurity threats, developed by analyzing various sources of information.

  ### Threat (in context of cybersecurity)
  Cybersecuirty threats are acts performed by individuals with harmful intent, whose goal is to steal data, cause damage or to disrupt computing systems.

  ### Exploit

  An exploit is a piece of code or a program that is used to take advantage of security flaws or vulnerabilities found in software and/or hardware, most of the time with the goal of installing malware. An exploit isn't a malware it's a method to deliver malware.

Example: An example from the booklet is the SQL that could be injected into a database in order to store, retrieve and manipulate data through simple commands. (page 5)

  ### Scope 
Scope is a part of a program where a particular variable, constant, function or identifier is visible and can be referenced or accessed. It is what we are aiming or looking for when we want to know where in the code an element has meaning and effect

  ### Engagement (in context of cybersecurity) 

Security engagement refers to a process of security training for employees so that they can identify threats by simulating real-life attack types.

  ### Black hat - White hat 
  -White Hat --> White hats are considered ethical hackers that improve security systems

  -Black Hat --> Black hats are considered malicious hackers that exploit systems for gains or to cause damage

  ### Vulnerabilities 
  Vulnerability refers to "the quality or state of being exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either 
  physically or emotionally."
  
  A vulnerability in cybersecurity is a weakness in an IT system that can be exploited by an attacker to deliver a 
  successful   attack. They can occur through flaws, features or user error

  ### Firewalls 
A piece of software (usually) that filters the information that enters and leaves in a system. They can be used to block malware. A DNS server can act as a firewall to block certain connections.

  ### Phising 
Impersonating a company or an individual to retrieve information or send malware. The most common type of phising is via emails that impersonate companies and try to make the user click on a link to get infected with malware.

  ### Port (in networks)

  ### IP address (v4 and v6)

  ### Social engineering
Using social knowledge to gain information.

  ### Asset (in the context of the case study)
   Assets are something that you own in  the case of the case study it is something we can adress as hackers or protect as cyber security for example client data.

  ### SQL  (what is use in this context?)
Simple Query Language (SQL) is a programming language to make queries in a data base, like for example "what is the best grade between the students?".

  ### User privilege 
Some users can be given administrator privliges which allow total access of an asset. For example, in a website administrators can access the data base.
  ### Malware 
Malware or viruses are malicious software that tries to steal information or block access to the user to certain functions for economic reasons. Spyware are a type of virus that retrievs passwords, tokens and personal information and sends it to a server without being seen by the user. Then a hacker can use that information and sell it on the darkweb, or blackmail the user. Ransomware blocks the users' access to the their files or computer to ask for a ransom. Trojan

  ### System log 

  ### Actionable recommendation (what do we mean by actionable?) 
Recommendations that the user or person reading are able of doing.

# Context definitions

## Purpose

This file has 2 intentions

1st is going to allow the students know the dynamic of how to use github and start editing information in markdown in this repository and start their research 

2nd is going to use more broad and basic terms that are used in the case study so they have a broad understanding before jumping in. 

  ## Definitions

  ### Hacker
Hacker is a person with advanced knowledge of computer systems, networks and programming that uses his knowledge to investigate or gain unauthorized access to systems, often by exploiting vulnerabilities

  ### Internal communication (in a hospital)
Internal communications in the context of a hospital is a broad term that refers to all the methods to communicate with the employees. In the context of computer science, it refers to digital methods. This communication is used to send information between the hospital’s system and the employees, between employees and between departments.  

Modern types of communication: 

    Email 

    Intranet systems

Old types of communication: 

    Pager/Beeper

  ### Internet of Things 
  Internet of things (IoT) refers to the network of devices with sensors, processing ability, software and the technology that connect and exchange data between devices and    the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. This means everyday tools like toothbrushes, cars or other machines can use sensors to gather data and respond to       users.

  ### Intelligence (in context of cybersecurity)
  
  The term intelligence stands for knowledge in the context of cybersecurity this knowledge concerns cybersecurity threats, developed by analyzing various sources of information.

  ### Threat (in context of cybersecurity)
  Cybersecuirty threats are acts performed by individuals with harmful intent, whose goal is to steal data, cause damage or to disrupt computing systems.

  ### Exploit

  An exploit is a piece of code or a program that is used to take advantage of security flaws or vulnerabilities found in software and/or hardware, most of the time with the goal of installing malware. An exploit isn't a malware it's a method to deliver malware.

Example: An example from the booklet is the SQL that could be injected into a database in order to store, retrieve and manipulate data through simple commands. (page 5)

  ### Scope 
Scope is a part of a program where a particular variable, constant, function or identifier is visible and can be referenced or accessed. It is what we are aiming or looking for when we want to know where in the code an element has meaning and effect

  ### Engagement (in context of cybersecurity) 

Security engagement refers to a process of security training for employees so that they can identify threats by simulating real-life attack types.

  ### Black hat - White hat 
  -White Hat --> White hats are considered ethical hackers that improve security systems

  -Black Hat --> Black hats are considered malicious hackers that exploit systems for gains or to cause damage

  ### Vulnerabilities 
  Vulnerability refers to "the quality or state of being exposed to the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either 
  physically or emotionally."
  
  A vulnerability in cybersecurity is a weakness in an IT system that can be exploited by an attacker to deliver a 
  successful   attack. They can occur through flaws, features or user error

  ### Firewalls 
A piece of software (usually) that filters the information that enters and leaves in a system. They can be used to block malware. A DNS server can act as a firewall to block certain connections.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### Phising 
Impersonating a company or an individual to retrieve information or send malware. The most common type of phising is via emails that impersonate companies and try to make the user click on a link to get infected with malware.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### Port (in networks)
An entry point that can be closed or opened por a website in a computer.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### IP address (v4 and v6)
An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label that is assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main functions: network interface identification, and location addressing.
An IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the address space to 2^32 addresses. They are usually represented in dot-decimal notation, consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots (such as 192.0.2.1). Each part represents a group of 8 bits of the address.
In IPv6, the address size was increased to 128 bits, providing up to 2^128 addresses.

  ### Social engineering
Using social knowledge to gain information.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### Asset (in the context of the case study)
Assets are something that you own. In the case of the case study, it is something owned by the hospital that can be adressed by hackers or protected by cybersecurity experts. Client data or the X-ray system in the hospital is an example of an asset.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### SQL  (what is use in this context?)
Simple Query Language (SQL) is a programming language to make queries in a data base, like for example "what is the best grade between the students?".
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### User privilege 
Some users can be given administrator privliges which allow total access of an asset. For example, in a website administrators can access the data base.
*(From class. Should be expanded)*

  ### Malware 

Malware (malicious software) is any software that blocks access to information in a system, disrupts the system, steals information or gains access to the system without permission. Although less common, malware also takes into account software that does not act maliciously on purpose but puts the privacy or security of a system at risk. Malware can also use the system’s resources to their advantage at the cost of the system’s performance, like Cryptominers. 

Types of malware: 

    Computer virus: replicates itself in the persistent memory and/or modifies code of programs of a computer. 

    Computer worm: replicates itself in other computers. 

    Trojan: camouflages itself as a regular program to pass under the user’s suspicion. 

    Spyware: malware that retrieves personal information and sends it to a server or a computer for a cybercriminal to access and blackmail or steal from the user. 

    Adware: a type of malware that displays ads without the users consent or knowledge. It can act as spyware sometimes. 

    Ransomware: a malicious program that encrypts the user’s data to force them to pay a ransom if they want their data back. 

    Keyloggers:

  ### System log 
A log or a type of journal of all the events that happen in the system,network or apps. this tool records everything that happens into a computer like system changes,startup messages ,warnings, errors,unexpected shutdowns, etc.

"Basically systems logs records all the details of a computer"

This tool is very helpful because:

-Error detection: It allow the programer to find out why a program fails 

-Security:detec suspicius activity(like unauthorized access or repeated failed logins) 

-computer-history:track who did what and when they did it 

-FORENSICS:allows the administrator about a cyberatack or a incident providing evidence

  ### Actionable recommendation (what do we mean by actionable?) 
Actionable recommendations are specific, realistic, and measurable suggestions that help clients achieve their goals and solve their problems. In this context, it is a concrete and feasible measure a hospital can take to strengthen cybersecurity. By actionable we refer to a measure that can be used as a reason for doing something.

In the case study there are several questions in the air that should be addressed. Here I write some of them in short so they are more easy to digest. 

This is meant to be address by students after working on the definitions

## About the hospital (MedTechPro Hospital)

 * It is written that is heavily reliant on technology, using electronic health records and medical devices that use IoT. To what extent is that true for regular hospitals around us? 

   ---
   Answer 1
Yes regular hospitals in spain are also heabily reliant of rechnology and use health recodres and medical devices using iot. For example most hospitals in spain use Spain’s Historia Clínica Digital del SNS (HCDSNS), which is a digital health record which enables regions to share core information nationally. Furthermore most hospital use interconnected technologies such as patien monitors, buldpumps etc.A typical U.S. hospital has between 10 and 15 medical devices per bed, which means a 1,000-bed hospital could have around 15,000 medical devices. Those devices include imaging devices, clinical IoT devices, and surgery devices.

 * Why assess specifically about that privacy of patient data?
 
   ---
   Answer 1

Assessing the privacy of sensitive patient information is key to building trust in healthcare, and protecting data from unauthorized access or disclosure. Regulatory frameworks such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the US and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU strictly enforce the ethical handling of patient data, ensuring privacy as the priority of healthcare organisations. If these organisations fail to ensure the privacy of patients, they can face legal consequences imposed by the abovementioned frameworks.

* Apart from the privacy of patient data, what other data could be worth protect?

   ---
   Answer 1

in the context of a hsopital theres is a lot of data apart from the patient data that should be protected, such as:

-operational and infraestructure data: This category covers the information needed to run the hospital, manage facilities, and ensure systems are secure.

-financial and hospital business data: Hospitals are large businesses that handle vast amounts of proprietary financial and contractual information.

-Strategic and Reputation Data: This information involves the high-level planning and evaluation of the hospital's services.

   Answer 2
   
All patient data is worth protecting in the healthcare context, however data can be categorized into electronically Protected Health Information (ePHI) of which consits of data such as: Medical and Health data, Genetic information, Billing and financial data, Mental and behavioural data.
Data can also be categorized into Personal identifiers of which include: Demographic data (names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers,etc.), Identification numbers such as social security and driver's licenses, etc. And lastly financial data which can be credit card numbers or any other financial account.

## About the penetration testing 

* For this context, which approach (black box, grey box, white box) would be the best for CyberHealth Security approach? (of course for this question there are different opinions, the importance is how do you argument it, also if you say grey box you should specify which parts are black and which white)

   ---
   Answer 1
  
In the context of CyberHealth Security company, the most appropriate approach for testing hospital's system would be grey box testing. It provides ethical balance between realism and data integrity. Since black box testing simulates how a real hacker would try to violate system's security, a hacker can disrupt some crucial medical services like life support of some patients. On the other hand, a white box testing, which gives full internal access to configurations and data, could compromise patient's sensitive data, making it less ethical and less representative of real world attacks. The grey box testing will be the most effective as it provides both black and white box methods. The black box method tests hospital's external facing systems such as online portals or remote access points, while white box testing would be applied to internal infrastructure systems such as EHR, databases and IoT devices, using fake data and limited credentials.

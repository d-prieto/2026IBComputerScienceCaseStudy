### Electronic Health Record (EHR)
Computer system that collects, stores and manages patient health data such as medical history, diagnoses, treatments and test results. This systen allows secure access and exchange between different medical centers

## Penetration test 
Simulating a hacker attack with different stages of knowlegde.
### Penetration testing execution standard 

### Black box penetration testing approach 
Tester has no provided information whatsoever, the tester follows the approach of an unprivileged attacker meaning the tester has no prior knowledge / no insider information.

Strengths: This scenario can be seen as the most authentic, demonstrating how an attacker with no inside knowledge would target and compromise an organisation, its the most realistic option 

Weaknesess: It is really costly since it requires more time and effort for discovery. The tester may miss deeper flaws from within the system.

### White box penetration testing approach
It involves sharing full network and system information with the tester, including network maps and credentials. Usefull for simulating a targeted attack on a specific system utilising as many attack vectors as possible.

Strengths: Allows in-depth analysis of code, architecture, and security controls. Its fast to uncover vulnerabilities and exploits

Weaknesess: Not realistic from an outsider threat. May be unrealistic since hackers don't normally have that much information

### Grey box penetration testing approach
Only limited information is shared with the tester. Usually this takes the form of login credentials. Grey box testing is useful to help understand the level of access a privileged user could gain and the potential damage they could cause.

Strengths: Grey box tests strike a balance between depth and efficiency and can be used to simulate either an insider threat or an attack that has breached the network perimeter.

Weaknesess: May overlook some external vulnerabilities or may miss very deep flaws only visible through complete code access.

## Data integrity 
Data integrity is a concept and process that ensures the accuracy, consistency and validity of an organization’s data. Organizations not only ensure the integrity of the data but guarantee they have accurate and correct data in their database.
In a hospital, data integrity can include keeping patient's private information, health report, diagnostic reports, and other records. The management of such data is a difficult task for health professionals. Attackers specifically target healthcare sub‐domains to manipulate valuable data.

## Rules of engagement
Rules of engagement describe a companies unified rules for users who want to do penetration testing on a companies online assets.They are the safety net that ensures security activities are effective, ethical, and legally sound. 
They safeguarde the companies infrastructure and customer data. RoE define the boundaries, expectations, and communication standards between all parties involved.

It consists of the following parts 
- scope definition (what systems, networks, and data can be tested or accessed)
- authorization ( by fx chief of IT) 
- communication protocols (who needs to be informed before, during, and after activities) 
- testing methods and limitations (f.x you might be allowed to do phishing but not a Denial of service attack which can   disrupt operations) 
- data handling and confidentiality ( how data uncoverd during penetration testing is stored, encrypted, shared, and eventually destroyed) 
- Incident handling procedures (If a tester discovers a live security breach unrelated to the current engagement) 
- exit criteria and reporting requirements (explaining what was done, what was found, and recommendations for remediation)

## Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

the practice of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence

This involves gathering data from sources such as websites, social media, news outlets, and public records to identify patterns, assess threats, and inform decision-making in various fields, including cybersecurity, national security, and business. 

in the context of cybersecurity: Many organizations use OSINT as a cybersecurity tool to help gauge security risks and identify vulnerabilities in their IT systems. Cybercriminals and hackers also use OSINT techniques for social engineering, phishing and exposing targets for cyberattacks.

## Network scanning

Network scanning is a proccess that involves finding active devices in a network by sending signals and checking the responses. It's mainly used for monitoring, management, and spotting vulnerabilities. This process is necessary to protect networks from cyberattacks, it's an essential network security tool and should be performed regularly since most of the time cyberattacks happen daily,

## Network mapping 

Network mapping is the process of developing visual representations of a network's physical and logical structure, including all of te devices that are connected.

Example of a network map;

## Network topologies 

Network topology refers to the logical and physical structure of a computer network's nodes and connections that control data flow between devices. Network topology is an important in network design and management since it affects network performance, security, and scalability.

Types:

- Point-to-point topology
- Bus topology
- Ring topology
- Star topology
- Tree topology
- Mesh topology
- Hybrid topology

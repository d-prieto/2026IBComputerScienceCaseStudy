### Electronic Health Record (EHR)
Computer system that collects, stores and manages patient health data such as medical history, diagnoses, treatments and test results. This systen allows secure access and exchange between different medical centers

## Penetration test 
Simulating a hacker attack with different stages of knowlegde.
### Penetration testing execution standard 

### Black box penetration testing approach 
Tester has no internal knowledge and acts like an external hacker. It's the most realistic way to measure what an outsider has access to and what vulnerabilities come with it. But it's slower to find deep flaws and may miss vulnerabilities
### White box penetration testing approach
Tester is given full access to the source code, configs, architecture and even credentials, so they can find flaws in the system internally simulating an attack from the inside. Although it is not realistic for external threat simulations.
### Grey box penetration testing approach
Tester receives limited internal information so they can find flaws partially priviledged attackers would exploit. It's a good in-between balancing costs and speed.

## Data integrity 
Data integrity is a concept and process that ensures the accuracy, consistency and validity of an organization’s data. Organizations not only ensure the integrity of the data but guarantee they have accurate and correct data in their database.
In a hospital, data integrity can include keeping patient's private information, health report, diagnostic reports, and other records. The management of such data is a difficult task for health professionals. Attackers specifically target healthcare sub‐domains to manipulate valuable data.

## Rules of engagement
Rules of engagement describe a companies unified rules for users who want to do penetration testing on a companies online assets.They are the safety net that ensures security activities are effective, ethical, and legally sound. 
They safeguarde the companies infrastructure and customer data. RoE define the boundaries, expectations, and communication standards between all parties involved.

It consists of the following parts 
- scope definition (what systems, networks, and data can be tested or accessed)
- authorization ( by fx chief of IT) 
- communication protocols (who needs to be informed before, during, and after activities) 
- testing methods and limitations (f.x you might be allowed to do phishing but not a Denial of service attack which can   disrupt operations) 
- data handling and confidentiality ( how data uncoverd during penetration testing is stored, encrypted, shared, and eventually destroyed) 
- Incident handling procedures (If a tester discovers a live security breach unrelated to the current engagement) 
- exit criteria and reporting requirements (explaining what was done, what was found, and recommendations for remediation)

## Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

the practice of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence

This involves gathering data from sources such as websites, social media, news outlets, and public records to identify patterns, assess threats, and inform decision-making in various fields, including cybersecurity, national security, and business. 

in the context of cybersecurity: Many organizations use OSINT as a cybersecurity tool to help gauge security risks and identify vulnerabilities in their IT systems. Cybercriminals and hackers also use OSINT techniques for social engineering, phishing and exposing targets for cyberattacks.

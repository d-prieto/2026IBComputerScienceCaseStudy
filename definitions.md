### Electronic Health Record (EHR)
Computer system that collects, stores and manages patient health data such as medical history, diagnoses, treatments and test results. This systen allows secure access and exchange between different medical centers

## Penetration test 
Simulating a hacker attack with different stages of knowlegde.
### Penetration testing execution standard 

### Black box penetration testing approach 
Tester has no internal knowledge and acts like an external hacker. It's the most realistic way to measure what an outsider has access to and what vulnerabilities come with it. But it's slower to find deep flaws and may miss vulnerabilities
### White box penetration testing approach
Tester is given full access to the source code, configs, architecture and even credentials, so they can find flaws in the system internally simulating an attack from the inside. Although it is not realistic for external threat simulations.
### Grey box penetration testing approach
Tester receives limited internal information so they can find flaws partially priviledged attackers would exploit. It's a good in-between balancing costs and speed. 
## Data integrity 

## Rules of engagement

## Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

the practice of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources to produce actionable intelligence

This involves gathering data from sources such as websites, social media, news outlets, and public records to identify patterns, assess threats, and inform decision-making in various fields, including cybersecurity, national security, and business.
